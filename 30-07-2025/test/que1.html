            🧩 Question1: Count Words Longer Than 3 Letters
            ✅ Task:
            Given a sentence (a string), write a function that returns how many words in it are longer than 3 characters.
            📌 Instructions:
            - Create a function with a **clear and meaningful name**
            - The function should **accept a sentence as input** (a string).
            - The function should return a number — the count of words longer than 3 letters.
            📝 Input Example:
            let sentence = "JavaScript is super fun to learn";
            🎯 Expected Output:
            4
        */

        function countWords (str) {
            let words = str.split(" ");
            let count = 0;
            for (let word of words) {
                if (word.length >= 3) count++;
            };
            return count;
        };
        let res = countWords("JavaScript is super fun to learn");
        console.log(res);
